**Sales Value:** 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (VERY HIGH)

---

### **2. Is the property currently occupied?** (Important)
**Why ask:** Affects closing timeline and logistics

**Options:**

**Options:**

- ( ) Yes, currently listed

## 💡 My Recommendation

### **Keep It Simple - Just Add 2 Questions:**

1. ✅ **Tier 1 Required Fields** (Name, Email, Phone, Owner checkbox)
2. ✅ **When do you want to sell?** (Timeline - you already want this)
3. ✅ **Why are you considering selling?** (Motivation - MOST IMPORTANT)
4. ✅ **Is the property occupied?** (Logistics - VERY USEFUL)

**Total: 7 fields only** - Quick to fill out, high conversion
