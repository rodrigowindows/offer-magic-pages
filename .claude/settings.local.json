      "Bash(git commit -m \"$(cat <<''EOF''\nfix: Generate demo comps near actual property location\n\n**Problem:**\nDemo comparables were always generated in Orlando downtown, even when \nproperty was in different cities (e.g., Eatonville 5 miles away).\nThis caused map pins to appear far from the subject property.\n\n**Solution:**\n- Updated generateFallbackComps to accept subject property coordinates\n- Generate random addresses within 1 mile radius of actual property\n- Use property lat/lng if available, fallback to Orlando center\n- Each comp gets random offset of ±0.028 degrees (~1 mile)\n\n**Technical Changes:**\n- generateFallbackComps signature: added subjectAddress, subjectLat, subjectLng params\n- Dynamic address generation using random street names + numbers\n- Coordinates calculated relative to subject property position\n- All 3 fallback calls now pass property coordinates\n\n**Result:**\nMap now correctly shows all comps clustered near the selected property,\nregardless of city. Comps in Eatonville appear in Eatonville, not Orlando.\n\n🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n)\")",
