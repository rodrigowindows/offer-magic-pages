## 💡 Pro Tips

### Tip 1: Start with Filters
Before using Batch Review, filter to your target properties:
```
Status: Pending
Tags: tier-1, tier-2
Score: 70+
```
This way you only review hot leads.

### Tip 2: Use Card View for Scanning
- Card view is best for quick visual scanning
- See 9-12 properties on screen at once
- Identify patterns (images, scores, offers)

### Tip 3: Use Table View for Data Entry
- Table view is best when updating multiple fields
- Bulk selection works better in table
- See more data columns side-by-side

### Tip 4: Keyboard > Mouse in Batch Mode
- Keep hands on keyboard: A, R, S
- 6x faster than clicking
- Review 100 properties in 8-10 minutes

### Tip 5: Filter by Date for Follow-ups
